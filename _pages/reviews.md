<h2>Coming Soon!</h2>

Browse the gallery of contributed reviews from KU students and the wider Lawrence community!

Starting at the end of September, we will begin posting reviews that come in from classes or our pop up events. Visit our site in early October to explore our community's thoughts on KU Libraries, the Jayhawk, and more!
